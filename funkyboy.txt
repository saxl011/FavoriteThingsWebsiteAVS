to the town of aqua fria rode a stranger one fine day
hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have to much to say
no one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip
the stranger there amoung them had a big iron on his hip
big iron on his hip

it was early in the morning when he rode into the town
he came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
"he's an outlaw loose and runnin'," came a whisper from each lip
and he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
big iron on his hip

in this town there lived an outlaw by the name of texas red
many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
he was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four
and the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
one and nineteen more

now the stranger started talkin', made it plain to folks around
was an arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
