to the town of aqua fria rode a stranger one fine day
hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have to much to say
no one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
the stranger there amoung them had a big iron on his hip
big iron on his hip

it was early in the mornin' when he rode into the town
he came ridin' from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
"he's an outlaw loose and runnin'," came a whisper from each lip
and he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
big iron on his hip

in this town there lived an outlaw by the name of texas red
many men had tried to take him, and that many men were dead
he was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four
and the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
one and nineteen more

now the stranger started talkin', made it plain to folks around
was an arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
he came here to take an outlaw back alive, or maybe dead
and he said it didn't matter, he was after texas red
after texas red

wasn't long before the story was relayed to texas red
but the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead
twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
twenty-one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
big iron on his hip

the morning passed so quickly; it was time for them to meet
it was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
folks were watching from the windows, everybody held their breath
they knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
about to meet his death

there was forty feet between 'em when they stopped to make their play
and the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
texas red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
and the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
big iron on his hip

it was over in a moment and the folks had gathered 'round
there before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
oh, he might've went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
when he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
big iron on his hip

big iron
big iron
when he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
big iron on his hip
